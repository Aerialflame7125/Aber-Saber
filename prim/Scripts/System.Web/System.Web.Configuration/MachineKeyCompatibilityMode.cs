	/// <summary>Use encryption methods that are available in .NET Framework version 4.5 and later versions. Compared to the encryption methods that are used for <see cref="F:System.Web.Configuration.MachineKeyCompatibilityMode.Framework20SP1" /> and <see cref="F:System.Web.Configuration.MachineKeyCompatibilityMode.Framework20SP2" />, the ciphertext that is generated by the default cryptographic routines is slightly smaller and is more resilient against certain classes of theoretical attacks. They also integrate with Windows 8 directory key management in order to get required cryptographic keys. This option also enables you to specify custom cryptographic routines by writing a class that derives from <see cref="T:System.Security.Cryptography.DataProtector" /> and specifying the class name in the <see cref="P:System.Web.Configuration.MachineKeySection.DataProtectorType" /> property.The following configuration requirements apply to this option:1. If the <see cref="P:System.Web.Configuration.MachineKeySection.DataProtectorType" /> property has a value, the <see cref="P:System.Web.Configuration.MachineKeySection.ApplicationName" /> property must also have a value.2. The <see cref="P:System.Web.Configuration.MachineKeySection.Validation" /> attribute must specify a system-defined validation algorithm (such as MD5, SHA1, HMACSHA256, HMACSHA384, or HMACSHA512) or a custom validation algorithm in a class that derives from the <see cref="T:System.Security.Cryptography.KeyedHashAlgorithm" /> class. The values AES and 3DES are not validation algorithms.When you specify this option, forms authentication tickets are always both encrypted and signed, regardless of the value specified for the <see cref="P:System.Web.Configuration.FormsAuthenticationConfiguration.Protection" /> property. View state is also both encrypted and signed if a page's <see cref="P:System.Web.UI.Page.EnableViewStateMac" /> property is <paramref name="true" /> or the <see cref="P:System.Web.UI.Page.ViewStateEncryptionMode" /> property is <see cref="F:System.Web.UI.ViewStateEncryptionMode.Always" />.</summary>
